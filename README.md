# Core Questions Form - Using PHP & MVC

## About
This is a web form where you can submit answers to the 'GP-Core Questions', which is used to report subjective wellbeing. 

**NB: This repo is very much a work in progress - as of 16 May currently working on adding Register & Login User functionality)**

It uses the LAMP stack, and will have basic CRUD functionality, storing data in a MYSQL db.

Its been cloned from an existing To Do app based on the Slim 4 framework and MVC Pattern.

It uses Routing, the Dependency Injection Container, Factories, Controllers & Views to implement CRUD funtionality
